openvpn recipe
==============

installs and configures openvpn in routed mode on a server and generates client config packages.

You will find the client config packages at /etc/openvpn/clients. 
The key will be protected by the password set in the clients line.
Additional a zip file will be generated (including the also secret ta.key)
which is then encrypted using symetric gpg encryption and the same password used for the key.

Attention: do not remove a generated key from pillar instead revoke the key.
To revoke a key, simple add its keyname to the "revoke:" section and call highstate or 
"salt-call state.sls roles.openvpn" again.

if your setup fails for some reasons, you can restart from scratch by using

salt-call state.sls roles.openvpn.absent

Issues:
Currently the private key is not encrypted.
